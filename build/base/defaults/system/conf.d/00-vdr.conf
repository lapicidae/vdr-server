[vdr]
#--audio=cmd
#    Send Dolby Digital audio to stdin of command cmd.

--chartab=ISO-8859-15
#    set the character table to use for strings in the
#    DVB data stream that don't begin with a character
#    table indicator, but don't use the standard default
#    character table (for instance ISO-8859-9)

#--daemon
#    Run in daemon mode (implies --no-kbd).

#--device=num
#    Use only the given DVB device (num = 0, 1, 2...).  There may be several -D options (by default all
#    DVB devices will be used).

#--dirnames=path[,name[,enc]]
#    Set  the  maximum  directory path length to path (default is the maximum value allowed on the sys‐
#    tem). If name is also given, it defines the maximum directory name length (default is the  maximum
#    value  allowed on the system).  The optional enc can be 0 or 1, and controls whether special char‐
#    acters in directory names are encoded as hex values (default: 0).  If path or name are left  empty
#    (as  in  ",,1"  to  only set enc), the defaults apply.  The length of the video directory name and
#    that of the actual recording directory is subtracted from path, to make sure  the  directory  path
#    will never become too long.

#--epgfile=/var/cache/vdr
#    Write the EPG data into the given file (default is epg.data in the cache directory).  Use  -E-  to
#    disable this.  If file is a directory, the file epg.data will be created in that directory.

#--filesize=size
#    Limit  video  files  to  size bytes (default is 2000M).  This option is only useful in conjunction
#    with --edit, and must precede that option to have an effect.  size is an integer number and may be
#    followed by one of the letters K, M, G or T to abbreviate Kilo-, Mega-, Giga- or Terabyte, respec‐
#    tively.  The given value is silently limited to the program's internal minimum and maximum values.

--grab=/tmp
#    Write images from the SVDRP command GRAB into the given directory dir. dir must be the  full  path
#    name  of an existing directory, without any "..", double '/' or symlinks. By default, or if -g- is
#    given, grabbing images to disk is disabled.

#--instance=instance
#    Use instance as the id of this VDR instance (default is  0).   In  an  environment  where  several
#    instances  of  VDR  use  the same video directory, this parameter can be set to a positive integer
#    value that's unique for each instance, so that they won't interfere with each other in  case  they
#    record  exactly  the  same broadcast.  The number given here will be part of the directory name in
#    which the recordings will be stored.

--log=1
#    Set logging to level.  0 = no logging, 1 = errors only, 2 = errors and info, 3 = errors, info  and
#    debug.   The  default  logging  level  is  3.   If logging should be done to LOG_LOCALn instead of
#    LOG_USER, add '.n' to LEVEL, as in 3.7 (n=0..7).

#--lib=dir
#    Search for plugins in directory dir (default is /usr/lib/vdr/plugins).  There can be several  -L  options
#    with different dir values.  Each of them will apply to the -P options following it.

#--lirc[=path]
#    Use a LIRC remote control device.  If path is omitted, vdr uses /var/run/lirc/lircd.

#--localedir=dir
#    Search for locale files in dir (default is /usr/share/locale).

#--mute
#    Mute audio of the primary DVB device at startup.

--no-kbd
#    Don't use the keyboard as an input device.

#--port=port
#    Use  port  for  SVDRP. A value of 0 turns off SVDRP. The default SVDRP port is 6419. You need to
#    edit the file svdrphosts.conf in order to enable access to the SVDRP port.
#

--record=/usr/bin/vdr-recordingaction
#    Call cmd before and after a recording. See the file INSTALL for more information.

#--resdir=dir
#    Read resource files from dir (default is /usr/share/vdr).

#--shutdown=/usr/bin/shutdown-wrapper
#    Call cmd to shutdown the computer. See the file INSTALL for more information.

#--terminal=tty
#    Set the controlling terminal.

#--user=vdr
#    Run as user user in case vdr was started as user 'root'.  Starting vdr as 'root' is  necessary  if
#    the system time shall be set from the transponder data, but for security reasons vdr can switch to
#    a lesser privileged user id during normal operation. The default is 'vdr'

#--userdump
#    Allow coredumps if -u is given (only for debugging).

#--watchdog=90
#    Activate the watchdog timer with a timeout of sec seconds.  A value of 0  (default)  disables  the
#    watchdog.


### Docker specific (!DO NOT CHANGE!) ###
#--config=/var/lib/vdr
#    Read config files from directory dir (default is /var/lib/vdr).

#--cachedir=/var/cache/vdr
#    Save cache files in dir (default is /var/cache/vdr).

#--video=/srv/vdr/video
#    Use dir as video directory. (default is /srv/vdr/video).
