# Format:
#
# nr text action
#
# nr:        the number of the CAM this action applies to (0 = all CAMs)

#            blanks, escape '"' with '\')
# action:    the action to take if the given text is encountered
#
# Possible actions are:
#
# - DISCARD:  simply discard the menu (equivalent to pressing 'Back' on the RC)
# - CONFIRM:  confirm the menu (equivalent to pressing 'OK' without selecting a
#             particular item)
# - SELECT:   select the menu item containing the text (equivalent to positioning
#             the cursor on the item and pressing 'OK')
# - <number>: the given number is sent to the CAM as if it were typed in by the user
#             (provided this is an input field).
#
# Note that the text given in a rule must match exactly, including any leading or
# trailing blanks. If in doubt, you can get the exact text from the log file.
# Action keywords are case insensitive.
